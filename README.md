# Introduction 
In this project, you will create a React application from scratch and utilize React components to manage the user interface. You’ll create a virtual bookcase to store your books and track what you're reading. Using the provided Books API, you’ll search for books and add them to a bookshelf as a React component. Finally, you’ll use React's setState to build the functionality to move books from one shelf to another.
